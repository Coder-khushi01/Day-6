# What is Safe Mode?

Safe Mode is a special way to start your computer with only the most important programs and drivers running. It helps you fix problems by stopping any extra software that might be causing trouble, like viruses or faulty programs.

## Why Use Safe Mode?

^ To remove viruses or malware that won’t let you delete them normally

^ To uninstall software or drivers causing crashes

^ To fix errors when your computer won’t start properly

## How to Start Safe Mode (Windows)

^ Hold Shift and click Restart on your computer.

^ Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Settings > Click Restart.

^ Press 4 (for Safe Mode) or 5 (for Safe Mode with Internet).

## Why Use Safe Mode?

^ To fix problems like crashes, viruses, or a very slow computer

^ To uninstall bad software or drivers

^ To run antivirus scans safely 

# What Are Recovery Tools?
Recovery Tools help fix your computer if it won’t start properly or if something is broken. They are special tools that help you fix bigger problems — like when your PC won’t start, or system files are broken.

## Common Recovery Tools:

 ^ Startup Repair – Fixes boot problems.

^ System Restore – Goes back to an earlier time when your PC worked.

^ Command Prompt – Lets you type commands to fix problems.

^ Reset This PC – Reinstalls Windows

# OS REPAIR.

OS Repair means fixing the software that runs your computer — called the Operating System (OS). For most PCs, this is Windows.

When the OS has problems (like crashes, errors, or slow performance), OS repair tools help find and fix these problems so your computer works well again.

## Why might you need OS repair?

^ Your computer is freezing or crashing

^ You get error messages or blue screens

^ Windows doesn’t start properly

^ Programs don’t open or keep closing

^ Files or settings are missing or broken

## How does OS repair work?

 ^ It checks important system files and replaces damaged or missing ones.
 
^ It can restore Windows to an earlier, healthy state.

^ It can fix startup problems so Windows boots correctly.

^ If needed, it can reset or reinstall Windows without deleting your personal files.
